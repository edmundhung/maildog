## 👋 Hey, why building this?

Since I bought my first domain, I am always tempted to use it as my email address.
However, as I am not receiving many emails a day, hosting my mail server or paying for an email hosting service either make it too complicated or costs too much.
All I want is simply a service forwarding emails to one single place.

I have been happily using [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) for years.
As they changed pricing last year, I started looking for a replacement but options are relatively limited.

After all, I open-sourced `maildog` and is looking for a community that shares the same needs as me.
The project aims to offer an extensible email forwarding solution with minimal maintenance and operational cost.

## ☁️ How it works?

## 💸 Pricing

Yes. While it is **FREE** to use `maildog`, you are still required to pay AWS for the infrastructure setup on the cloud.
To give you a better idea, here is an **estimated** price breakdown based on the following assumption:

- 10k emails / month or 333 emails / day
- 100KB mail size in average
- Hosted in US West (Oregon), pricing may be slightly different based on the region
- Counted without any [free quota](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

## 🚨 Limitations

### Amazon SES sandbox

SES restricts new users by placing them in the sandbox.
Depends on your usage, if you would like to forward emails to [non-verified addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)
or with higher volume, you might want to [move out of the sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html)

### Maximum numbers of domains/alias allowed

`maildog` configures SES using a receipt ruleset with a [hard limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/quotas.html) of up to 200 rules and 100 recipients per rule. In general, domains that are configured with fallback emails could be set with only 1 rule using wildcard. But for domains without fallback emails, every 100 alias will be count as 1 rule. As a result, you can set up to 20,000 alias if you are configuring only 1 domain even with no fallback emails.

### Regions support

Not every region supports receiving emails with AWS SES. As of 30 June 2021, only 3 regions you can deploy `maildog` on:

1. US East (N. Virginia)
2. US West (Oregon)
3. Europe (Ireland)

Please check the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/regions.html#region-receive-email) for the latest update.
